scription\'><p>Join Nicolas Sarkozy, former President of France, as he signed his latest book, <em>Passions</em>, recently published in France with \xc3\xa9ditions de l&#8217;Observatoire.</p><p>&#8220;All of my life I have been lucky, very lucky, perhaps even too lucky when I think of those who don&#8217;t have any other choice but to face the grayness of a despairing and, often, painful daily life. That is not to say that I was spared of hardships. I had my share of professional and personal failures. I even have the impression of having had to pay a high price for success. But never ever have I been bored. As far back as I can remember, I have been able to live passionately, to meet exceptional people, and to be face to face with events that history will remember. Passion and the need to be engaged have always been present in the heart of my identity. Deep down, if I do not know the why of this inclination that is so anchored in myself, at least I have had the desire to explain the how. I took a lot of time before embarking on this path of truth that I want to be as sincere as possible, even if I know it will be, by nature, relative. &#8221; -Nicolas Sarkozy</p><p>Free and open to the public.
